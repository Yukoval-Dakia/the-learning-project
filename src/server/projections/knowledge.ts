// YUK-471 W1 PR-A2a — projectKnowledgeNode: the IO shell around the PURE node fold.
//
// This is the read→fold→write-through shell that PR-B will flip the live accept path
// to as the SOLE writer of a `knowledge` row. It:
//   1. GATHERS the superset of `event` rows that can affect `nodeId` (the pure reducer
//      filters internally, but the shell must over-collect, not under-collect — a
//      missed event silently drops a mutation from the projection),
//   2. maps each DB row → the flat FoldEvent envelope,
//   3. calls foldKnowledgeNode(nodeId, foldEvents) (PURE),
//   4. WRITE-THROUGH: null → DELETE the row; else upsert the projected columns.
//
// BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING (PR-A2a): this shell is ADDED + DB-tested but NOT yet called by
// acceptProposal / actions.ts / any live write path (no double-write, no SoT flip —
// those are PR-A2b / PR-B). Do not wire it in here.
//
// ── The gather problem (why three queries + a rate resolution) ──────────────────────
// Most node mutations key on the event's own `subject_id` (reparent / archive / auto_tag
// → subject_id IS the node id; merge-as-into → subject_id IS the into node; split-as-from
// → subject_id IS the source node; genesis → subject_id IS the row id). Those are Q1.
//
// But two CREATE shapes mint a node id that is NOT the event subject_id:
//   - propose_new: subject_kind='knowledge', subject_id = the PROPOSAL id (not the node);
//     the minted node id lives in the accepting RATE's payload.materialized_ids.knowledge[0].
//   - split: subject_id = the SOURCE node (from_id); the new node ids live in the accepting
//     RATE's payload.materialized_ids.knowledge (order matches payload.into[]).
// For a node BORN this way, no event has subject_id === nodeId, so Q1 misses it entirely.
// The materialized_id_index (PR-A2a Index phase) maps nodeId → its anchor event id; Q2
// pulls that anchor event PLUS everything caused_by it (the anchor's accepting rate).
//
// And one ARCHIVE shape keys on ANOTHER node: when nodeId is merged INTO another node,
// the merge event's subject_id is the into_id, and nodeId only appears in payload.from_ids.
// Q3 finds that merge via a jsonb-containment scan on payload->'from_ids'.
//
// Finally the reducer needs the RATE events (accepted-only gate + materialized_ids +
// accept-time stamp), so after gathering the propose/mutation events we fetch the rates
// chained to them (caused_by_event_id IN gathered-ids).
//
// Db|Tx polymorphic; upsert/DELETE shape mirrors upsertFsrsState (src/server/fsrs/state.ts)
// + restore-snapshot.ts's before!=null upsert / before=null DELETE branch.
//
// The read→fold half (the Q1/Q2/Q3 + rate gather described above) lives in the SHARED
// gather.ts so this shell and scripts/audit-projection.ts reconstruct a row IDENTICALLY —
// a single gather implementation means the drift auditor can never be blind to a gather bug
// in the SoT path. This shell adds only the WRITE-THROUGH on top of that shared read→fold.
