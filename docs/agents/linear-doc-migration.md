# Linear Document Migration

This is the control plane for migrating repo Markdown into Linear without losing
the codebase as source of truth.

## Ground Rules

- The repo remains the source of truth for executable facts: code, schema, ADRs,
  implementation plans, audit trails, agent skills, and local setup.
- Linear is the management surface: current status, roadmap execution map,
  issue ownership, milestones, status updates, and searchable document index.
- No document is copied to Linear until its freshness verdict is known.
- Linear documents must include source path, source commit, verification date,
  freshness verdict, and a note that the repo remains source of truth.
- Do not migrate secrets, webhook secrets, API keys, `.env*`, personal MCP
  config, or local-only machine paths except as non-sensitive repo paths.
- GitHub Issues are historical only. New planning, triage, and roadmap work uses
  Linear `YUK-*` identifiers.

## Linear Containers

Create and maintain one Linear project for the migration:

| Linear object | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Project | `Project Ops — Roadmap & Docs SOT` | Central project for repo-to-Linear docs governance. |
| Milestone | `M1 — Freshness Audit + Manifest` | Establish repo freshness rules and generated manifest. |
| Milestone | `M2 — Linear Document Migration` | Publish current docs and indexes into Linear. |
| Milestone | `M3 — Issue/Status Reconciliation` | Reconcile existing `YUK-*` issues against shipped code. |

Create these project documents:

| Linear document | Source | Migration mode |
|---|---|---|
| `Doc Catalog — Repo ↔ Linear Manifest` | this file + `pnpm docs:linear-manifest` | full doc + generated manifest summary |
| `Current Status Snapshot` | `docs/superpowers/status.md` | full doc after freshness refresh |
| `Roadmap Execution Map` | `docs/planning/v0.3-generalized-ai-learning-framework.md` | summarized execution map |
| `Historical References Index` | ADRs, audits, plans, specs, design bundles | index only; repo keeps full text |

## Freshness Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning | Linear action |
|---|---|---|
| `current` | Verified against current code and recent commits. | Eligible for full or summarized Linear migration. |
| `current-reference` | Active reference for current work but not the top-level status source. | Link from Linear; do not duplicate unless useful. |
| `needs-refresh` | Known stale or materially behind current code. | Refresh repo first, then migrate. |
| `needs-review` | Not proven stale, but not yet verified against adjacent code. | Catalog only until reviewed. |
| `historical-reference` | Valuable evidence/history, not current execution state. | Put in Historical References Index only. |
| `scratch-do-not-migrate` | Temporary handoff or session-local state. | Extract still-valid work into issues; do not mirror. |

## Generated Manifest

Run this from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm docs:linear-manifest
```

The command maps every `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard
'*.md' '*.mdx'` path to:

- `repo_path`
- `role`
- `freshness`
- `last_source_commit`
- `verified_against`
- `linear_destination`
- `migration_action`
- `notes`

As of the 2026-05-23 Project Ops closeout, `README.md` has been refreshed to
the current Next/Postgres/pg-boss stack and the generated manifest is the
complete path-level mapping. This file defines the policy and the Linear
destinations; rerun the command before every Linear document refresh.

## Current Migration Decisions

| Source | Verdict | Linear destination | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/superpowers/status.md` | `current` after 2026-05-23 refresh | `Current Status Snapshot` | Full doc. |
| `docs/planning/v0.3-generalized-ai-learning-framework.md` | `current` after 2026-05-23 refresh | `Roadmap Execution Map` | Summary with source link. |
| `docs/agents/*.md` | `current` | `Doc Catalog — Repo ↔ Linear Manifest` | Mirror operational docs or link from catalog. |
| `PLANNING.md` | `historical-reference` | `Historical References Index` | Link only; not active roadmap. |
| `RESUME.md` | `scratch-do-not-migrate` | Linear issues | Reviewed 2026-05-23; still-valid leftovers mapped to `YUK-13`, `YUK-14`, `YUK-15`, `YUK-17`, `YUK-47`, `YUK-48`, `YUK-49`, `YUK-50`, and `YUK-51`; scratch/local notes are not mirrored. |
| `README.md` | `current` | Catalog only | Current project entrance after 2026-05-23 refresh; do not duplicate full README in Linear unless a future mirror is explicitly needed. |
| `docs/adr/*.md` | `historical-reference` | `Historical References Index` | Link only. |
| `docs/audit/*.md` | `historical-reference` | `Historical References Index` | Link only. |
| `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs,brainstorms,audits}/*.md` | `historical-reference` or `current-reference` | `Historical References Index` | Link only. |
| `docs/modules/*.md` | `needs-review` | `Historical References Index` | Review against module code before promoting. |
| `docs/design/**` | `historical-reference` | `Historical References Index` | Link only unless refreshed by a new design pass. |
| `src/**/README.md` | `needs-review` | Catalog only | Keep near code; Linear links only. |

## Update Procedure

1. Run `git status --short --branch` and `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
2. Run `pnpm docs:linear-manifest`; if `tsx` hits sandbox IPC `EPERM`, rerun
   outside sandbox with the same command.
3. Refresh repo docs first when a source is `needs-refresh`.
4. Create or update Linear documents only after source paths and commits are
   known.
5. Reconcile Linear issues with code evidence; mark issues `Done` only when the
   shipped code, tests, and docs satisfy the issue description.
6. Add or update `YUK-*` references in PR titles/descriptions/commits; do not
   create new GitHub Issues for planning work.
